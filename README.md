### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ”­ I build Android and iOS apps - Native Android and Flutter apps. I write Java, Kotlin and Dart. I love the theatrics behind building and consuming API's.
- ðŸŒ± In my free time, I build API's with Node js, Javascript, Express and MongoDB.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that would open me up to newer challenges.
- ðŸ‘½ Iâ€™m looking to gradually learn something completely outside my field, just for fun. I write copy for fun and money too, lol.
- ðŸ“« You can always reach me through my Gmail.

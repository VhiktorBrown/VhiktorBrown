- ðŸ”­ I am VictorðŸ‘‹. I enjoy building Mobile apps. I started out as an Android developer and then transitioned into a Flutter developer.

- I am very comfortable with the Flutter framework and Dart programming language. I am also very proficient in Java and Kotlin seeing as these were the languages I started out with.

- I have been in the Mobile developing space for almost 4 years now and within this time, I have deployed a number of apps to the Playstore.

- I am a contributor to the open source community. I developed a library that helps developers accept payments in their app with just few lines of code. You'll find this repo in my repositories space. I hope to find the time to build more libraries.

- While I was in the University, I founded this idea with 2 of my friends which we worked on and today it's an app that's bringing thousands of undergraduates closer to their academic goals. You can check it out [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.iquest_unizik)
  
- ðŸŒ± I developed an interest in building API's that power frontend technology almost 2 years ago and I learnt how to build API's with Javascript, Express and I do that only for fun or for personal projects.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ It gives me immense joy knowing that products I build somehow make the lives of thousands of people out there better - people that I might never meet in my life. It's beautiful building actual solutions and that's what I have dedicated my life to doing.
  
- Here are some of the apps that I have built and deployed to Playstore.

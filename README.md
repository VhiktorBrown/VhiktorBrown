### Hey you 👋



- 🔭 I build Android and iOS apps. I write Java, Kotlin and Dart for Flutter. I love the theatrics behind building and consuming API's.
- 🌱 In my free time, I build API's with Node js, Javascript, Express and MongoDB.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on projects that would open me up to newer and tougher challenges.
- 👽 I have spent the last 6 months building [Syticks MVP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.syticks) and the MVP for [Syticks For Organizers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.syticks_organizers)

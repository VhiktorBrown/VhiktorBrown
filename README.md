### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 2 projects with 2 teams that would be out soon, primarily focused on android development and it's intricacies.
- ðŸŒ± I recently started learning how to build API's with both the spring framework(spring boot) and also with PHP.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a project that would introduce me to something new. I love to learn on the go.
- ðŸ‘½ Iâ€™m looking for help with learning the ins and outs of Ethical hacking.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ... Reach me through my Gmail on my profile.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ... If you find purpose in what you do, you would lose yourself in it. That's what coding does to me.

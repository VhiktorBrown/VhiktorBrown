### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 2 projects with 2 teams. One is out and we're working on a subsequent version. Other is still in development.
- ðŸŒ± I recently started learning how to build API's with Node js. I am also well versed with working with Firebase.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on a project that would introduce me to something new. I love to learn on the go.
- ðŸ‘½ Iâ€™m looking for help with learning the ins and outs of Ethical hacking, something like a mentor?.
- ðŸ“« Reach me through my Gmail on my profile.

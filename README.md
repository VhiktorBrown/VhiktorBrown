### Hey you ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ”­ I build Android and iOS apps. I write Java, Kotlin and Dart for Flutter. I love the theatrics behind building and consuming API's.
- ðŸŒ± In my free time, I build API's with Node js, Javascript, Express and MongoDB.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that would open me up to newer and tougher challenges.
- ðŸ‘½ I have spent the last 6 months building [Syticks MMP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.syticks) and the MMP for [Syticks For Organizers](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.syticks_organizers)

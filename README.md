- I am VictorðŸ‘‹. I enjoy building Mobile apps. I started out as an Android developer and then transitioned into a Flutter developer.

- I am very comfortable with the Flutter framework and Dart SDK. I am also very proficient in Java and Kotlin seeing as these were the languages I started out with.

- I have been in the Mobile developing space for over 4 years now and within this time, I have deployed a significant number of apps to Playstore and the Appstore.

- I have contributed to the open source community. I developed a [library](https://github.com/VhiktorBrown/Paystack-webview-android) that helps developers accept payments through Paystack in their app with just few lines of code.

- While I was in the University, I came up with this idea with 2 friends which we worked on and today, it's an app that's bringing thousands of undergraduates closer to their academic goals. You can check it out [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.app.iquest_unizik)
  
- ðŸŒ± I developed an interest in building API's that power frontend technology almost 2 years ago and I learnt how to build API's with Javascript, Express JS and I do that only for fun or for personal projects.

- I have a Medium following where I write about How-to's, share my development experience and write about anything and everything concerning building relevant & impactful projects. Do check it out [here](https://medium.com/@victorrebuka).

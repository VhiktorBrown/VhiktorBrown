### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently writing Kotlin, Java Android apps and Flutter apps for businesses. I love the theatrics behind consuming API's.
- ðŸŒ± I recently started learning how to build API'using the Express Framework with Node js, while using Mongo DB as my Database.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that would open me up to newer challenges.
- ðŸ‘½ Iâ€™m looking to gradually learn something completely outside my field, just for fun. I write copy for fun and money too, lol.
- ðŸ“« My Gmail is open 24/7 (on my profile)
